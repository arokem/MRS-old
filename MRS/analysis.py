    Combine data across coils based on the amplitude of the water peak,

    .. math::
        
        signal = sum_{i}(w(i)sig(i))

        w(i) = s(i)/(sqrt(sum(s(i)))
        
    where s(i) is the amplitude of the water peak in each coil.

    signals from each coil are 0

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : float array
       The data as it comes from the scanner (read using the functions in
       files.py), with shape (transients, echos, coils, time points)
    
    w_idx : tuple
       The indices to the non-water-suppressed transients. Per default we take
        the 2nd-4th transients. We dump the first one, because it seems to be
        quite different than the rest of them...

    coil_dim : int
        The dimension on which the coils are represented. Default: 2

    sampling rate : float
        The sampling rate in Hz. Default : 5000.

    Notes
    -----
    Following [Wald1997]_, we compute weights on the different coils based on
    the amplitudes and phases of the water peak. The signal from different
    coils is combined as:

    .. math :: 

        S = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{w_i * S_i}

    In addition, a phase correction is applied, so that all coils have the same
    phase.
